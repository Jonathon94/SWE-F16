Once upon a time


There was a bigfoot living in an mountain.
And he was desperately looking for a pair of shoes to keep his feet warm during the winter.
He asked Santa for some 'sick kicks' for Christmas. However he decided he needed a pair of socks at the very least until then.
Because of his unsual size of feet, he couldn't find one in the local town
Have you tried Ebay?------One of this friend asked

I haven't used ebay since I saw someone selling an inflatable hedgehog--that's not cool!----professed the bigfoot

The end.
